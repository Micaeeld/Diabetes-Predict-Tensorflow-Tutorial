# TensorFlow Diabetes Classification Tutorial
In this notebook, I'll walk you through step-by-step how to use TensorFlow to classify people with or without diabetes based on a dataset. We will use Kaggle's "Diabetes Prediction Dataset" dataset, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- Autoviz
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
You can install them using the pip install command followed by the library name.

## Tutorial Steps
1. Importing the necessary libraries
2. Loading and Exploring the Data
3. Data pre-processing
4. Splitting the data into training and testing sets
5. Creating the classification model using TensorFlow
6. Training the model
7. Evaluating model performance
